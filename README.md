urls.py - This file is responsible for mapping URLs to specific views in your Django app. When a user makes a request to your app (e.g. by typing in a URL in their web browser), Django will look at the URL and try to match it to a view based on the patterns defined in your urls.py file. For example, if a user types in "https://www.example.com/posts/1/", Django will look at the urls.py file to see which view is responsible for handling requests to that URL.
In your case, you'll need to define URLs for various endpoints in your API (e.g. an endpoint for creating a new post, an endpoint for getting a list of all posts, etc.). You'll use the urls.py file to map those URLs to specific views that will handle those requests.

serializers.py - Serializers are a way of converting complex data types (e.g. Django models) into a format that can be easily transmitted over the internet (e.g. JSON). In your app, you'll likely have several different models (e.g. a model for users, a model for posts, etc.), and you'll need to be able to convert instances of those models into JSON so that they can be transmitted over the API.
To do this, you'll create serializer classes that define how each model should be converted into JSON. For example, you might create a PostSerializer class that converts instances of your Post model into JSON objects that contain all of the relevant information about that post (e.g. the post text, the user who created the post, etc.).

models.py - Models are the backbone of your Django app. They define the structure of the data that your app will store (e.g. what fields a post should have, what fields a user should have, etc.). In your models.py file, you'll define all of the models that your app will use.
To create a model, you'll define a Python class that inherits from Django's Model class. Each attribute of the class will correspond to a field in the database. For example, if you want to create a Post model, you might define a class like this:

scss
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
This model would have three fields: text (a text field that stores the text of the post), created_at (a datetime field that stores when the post was created), and author (a foreign key field that links the post to the user who created it).

views.py - Views are responsible for handling incoming requests to your app. In your case, you'll need to create views that handle requests to your API endpoints (e.g. a view that creates a new post, a view that gets a list of all posts, etc.).
To create a view, you'll define a Python function that takes a request
